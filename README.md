# GAN Digits

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images of handwritten digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator, both of which are trained simultaneously to improve the quality of the generated images.

Also attempted to implement a GAN to generate colorful portraits using dataset, but due to the high number of variables and colors, the process kept crashing the computer, and no results were obtained.
